    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task One: Customer Review Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, I scraped and analyzed customer review data to uncover key insights and sentiments. From sentiment analysis to issue identification, we delved into the realm of customer reviews, extracting valuable insights to enhance the British Airways experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Two: Predictive Model Building\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second task, I developed a predictive model to understand the factors influencing buying behavior for British Airways. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the model aimed to predict customer preferences and behavior, helping the company tailor its services and offerings accordingly.\n",
